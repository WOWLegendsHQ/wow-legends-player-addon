-- WoWLegendsPlayer/UI/Tabs/DungeonClear.lua
-- Dungeon Clear (new in repack v1.4.0): a TANK BOT runs the dungeon for the
-- group while you play along as a follower. Commands act on the group's
-- elected leader tank bot; any real player in its group may issue them.
-- Authored from handoffs/2026-07-14_v1.4.0_player_addon_commands.md.
--
-- The $ run controls only work INSIDE a dungeon and are forced to party/raid
-- chat (botScope="all") — that always reaches the elected tank, regardless of
-- the Bots tab's scope selector. The info/extras rows are dot-commands and
-- work anywhere. Chat announcements arrive via Core/DungeonClear.lua.
